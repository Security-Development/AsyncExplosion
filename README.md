# AsyncExplosion
AsyncExplosion is a PocketMine-MP 5 plugin designed to handle explosions asynchronously, providing a smoother and more efficient gameplay experience. This plugin leverages asynchronous tasks to manage block changes during explosions, reducing server lag and improving overall performance. The plugin is inspired by matcracker's AsyncExplosion and updated for PM5 compatibility.
